Voting System dApp

This decentralized application allows users to participate in elections that are both fair and transparent, all powered by blockchain technology. The voting process is managed by Solidity smart contracts, ensuring that each vote is securely casted. The app works seamlessly with MetaMask for easy interaction, while Hardhat is used for building and testing the smart contracts.

Key Features:

Secure Voting: Cast votes knowing that each vote is protected and irreversible through Ethereum smart contracts.
Prevent Double Voting: The system ensures that each user can only vote once, keeping the election process fair and trustworthy.
Transparent Results: Election outcomes are automatically calculated and displayed on the blockchain, ensuring total transparency.
MetaMask Integration: Effortlessly interact with the dApp using MetaMask, providing smooth wallet management and transaction handling.

Technologies Used:

Solidity for building smart contracts
Hardhat for smart contract development and testing
MetaMask for secure wallet management and user interaction
React for building the frontend user interface
